# Conflict Reducing Innovations in Development Enable Increased Multicellular Complexity


## README

This repo contains all data and scripts for all analyses run for the manuscript. 

The `Data` folder contains the data and associated references. 

The `RScripts` folder contains all the scripts for running the analysis. 

To run, edit line 2 of `RScripts/RunAllAnalyses.R` to reflect your working dir.
Then `cd` to this directory, and run `RScript RScripts/RunAllAnalyses.R`.
This will run all permutations of the analyses that are presented in the manuscript. 
It will create the `Results` folder, and all files and folders within it-- including the figures that are presented in the manuscript (although they are compiled using illustrator/inkscape)
It will *eventually* also create the supplementary information.
